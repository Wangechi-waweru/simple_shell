Njeri Waweru and Lynn Waweru Shell project.

This is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX SE.

After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.
